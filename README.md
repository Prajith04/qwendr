# Medical Symptom Checker

An interactive medical symptom checker that helps users explore symptoms and related diseases using vector similarity search and a database of medical conditions.

## Features

- Enter symptoms to find related diseases
- See semantically similar symptoms through vector search
- Discover related symptoms from matching diseases
- Interactive UI for refining symptom selection
- Get detailed disease information from Groq's LLM API

## How It Works

1. **Vector Search**: Uses Sentence Transformers and Qdrant to find semantically similar symptoms
2. **Database Matching**: Finds diseases that match all selected symptoms
3. **Related Symptoms**: Shows other symptoms from matching diseases
4. **AI-Powered Disease Information**: Uses Groq's API to generate detailed disease information

## Usage

Enter a symptom in the search box (e.g., "fever", "cough", "headache") and click "Search" or press Enter.

The system will:
1. Show diseases that have that symptom
2. Display semantically similar symptoms
3. Show other symptoms from the matching diseases

Click on any symptom in the "Similar Symptoms" or "Related Symptoms" sections to add it to your selection. This will narrow down the diseases to those that have ALL selected symptoms.

Click on any disease name to view detailed information about the disease generated by Groq's LLM API.
